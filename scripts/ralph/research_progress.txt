# Senter Autonomous Research - Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-08
Philosophy: Every story delivers demo-able value with quality gates, not just passing tests.

## Story Philosophy

Each story has:
1. VALUE STATEMENT - Why this matters to a user
2. DEMO SCRIPT - Step-by-step to show it working
3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - Experience-based, not implementation-based
4. QUALITY GATE - Manual or automated verification that it's actually good
5. TECHNICAL TESTS - Traditional unit/integration tests

## Quality Gate Types

- manual_review: Human rates output quality
- content_verification: Verify real content, not just structure
- human_rating: Rate on scale (clarity, usefulness, accuracy)
- ux_review: Can a human complete tasks without guidance?
- design_review: Is it visually appealing and professional?
- feedback_loop: Does the system learn from feedback?
- fresh_install: Does it work from scratch?

## Implementation Notes

### Patterns Learned

1. **Conditional imports for optional dependencies** - Wrap imports in try/except
2. **Headless classes for testability** - Create mock versions for CI
3. **Path handling for scripts** - Use `sys.path.insert` for relative imports
4. **LLM fallbacks** - Pattern-based extraction when LLM unavailable
5. **Concurrent fetching** - ThreadPoolExecutor for web requests

### Key Decisions

- **ddgs** over duckduckgo-search (package renamed)
- **SQLite** for persistence (simple, no setup)
- **rumps** for menubar (native macOS)
- **PyQt6** for panel (glassmorphism styling)
- **Ollama** for LLM (local, free)

### Demo Commands

```bash
# Check dependencies
python scripts/start_senter.py --check

# Run demo
python scripts/start_senter.py --demo

# Show status
python scripts/start_senter.py --status

# Research a topic
python scripts/start_senter.py --research "event sourcing"

# Run all tests
python scripts/start_senter.py --test

# Start menubar app
python scripts/start_senter.py
```

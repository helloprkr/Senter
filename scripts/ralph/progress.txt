# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-07
Project: Senter 3.0 Depth Improvements

## Codebase Patterns
- Stack: Python 3.10+ / Custom Framework
- Test runner: pytest with pytest-asyncio (asyncio_mode = "auto")
- Lint: ruff (line-length = 100)
- Memory: SQLite in data/memory.db
- Config: genome.yaml parsed by GenomeParser
- Async: Most methods are async, use `await` pattern
- Type hints: Used throughout, TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular deps
- Dataclasses: Used for data structures (Episode, Goal, Mutation, etc.)

## Key Files
- `core/engine.py` - Senter class, main interact() loop
- `core/composer.py` - ResponseComposer, CompositionContext
- `intelligence/activity.py` - ActivityMonitor, ScreenCapture, ContextInferencer
- `intelligence/goals.py` - GoalDetector, Goal dataclass
- `intelligence/proactive.py` - ProactiveSuggestionEngine
- `evolution/mutations.py` - MutationEngine, Mutation dataclass
- `evolution/fitness.py` - FitnessTracker
- `memory/living_memory.py` - LivingMemory, Episode, MemoryContext
- `memory/semantic.py` - SemanticMemory
- `memory/episodic.py` - EpisodicMemory
- `memory/procedural.py` - ProceduralMemory
- `memory/affective.py` - AffectiveMemory
- `coupling/human_model.py` - HumanModel, HumanCognitiveState
- `coupling/trust.py` - TrustTracker
- `daemon/senter_daemon.py` - SenterDaemon, background task execution
- `tools/file_ops.py` - File operations (currently stub)
- `tests/test_vision.py` - Existing vision tests

## Architecture Notes
- Engine loads genome.yaml via GenomeParser
- Memory uses 4 layers: semantic, episodic, procedural, affective
- Models created via create_model() factory in models/base.py
- LLM calls use async pattern: await self.model.generate(prompt)
- Embeddings via EmbeddingModel wrapper
- Daemon uses Unix socket IPC for client communication
- Trust level gates proactive behavior (>0.6 for suggestions, >0.8 for proactive)

## Existing Patterns to Follow
- Store in memory: `self.memory.semantic.store(content, domain)`
- Search memory: `results = self.memory.semantic.search(query)`
- LLM call: `response = await self.model.generate(prompt)`
- Embedding: `vec = await self.embeddings.embed(text)`
- Episode access: `episodes = self.memory._episodic.get_recent(limit=50)`

## 2026-01-07 - US-001: Add LLM-based context inference to ActivityMonitor
- Implemented: LLMContextAnalysis dataclass and infer_context_with_llm() async method
- Files changed:
  - intelligence/activity.py (added LLMContextAnalysis, infer_context_with_llm method)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (created with 12 tests for LLM context inference)
- Learnings:
  - LLM inference should always have fallback to heuristics
  - JSON parsing from LLM needs regex extraction since responses may have extra text
  - Use every 10th cycle for LLM inference to balance accuracy vs cost
  - Mock AsyncMock for testing async LLM calls
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-002: Add project detection to ActivityMonitor
- Implemented: ProjectDetector class and integration with ActivityMonitor
- Files changed:
  - intelligence/activity.py (added ProjectDetector class, integration in _capture_cycle)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 12 tests for project detection)
- Learnings:
  - Pattern-based detection works well for IDE window titles
  - Store project frequency for later goal suggestions
  - Prefer LLM-detected project over pattern-detected when available
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-003: Integrate ActivityMonitor with goal suggestion
- Implemented: Activity-to-goal pipeline with source tracking
- Files changed:
  - intelligence/goals.py (added source field, create_activity_inferred_goal, get_goals_by_source)
  - intelligence/activity.py (added goal suggestion methods)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 12 tests for activity-goal integration)
- Learnings:
  - Use minimum snapshot threshold (10) to avoid spurious goal creation
  - Track goal source for filtering and audit
  - Suggest goals based on both context type and project name
  - Confidence should scale with observation frequency
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-004: Add LLM-based semantic goal detection
- Implemented: LLM-powered goal detection from conversation history
- Files changed:
  - intelligence/goals.py (added detect_goals_semantically, _parse_llm_goal_response)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 11 tests for semantic detection)
- Learnings:
  - JSON extraction needs both direct parse and regex fallback
  - Filter out short descriptions (<5 chars) to avoid noise
  - Clamp confidence to 0.3-0.9 range to avoid extremes
  - Support both direct episode list and memory fetch patterns
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-005: Add goal progress detection via LLM
- Implemented: Progress and completion detection from text
- Files changed:
  - intelligence/goals.py (added _detect_progress_from_text, _update_goal_by_topic, detect_progress_with_llm)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 12 tests for progress detection)
- Learnings:
  - Process progress patterns BEFORE completion patterns to avoid overlap
  - Use Jaccard similarity for fuzzy topic matching
  - Progress should only increase, never decrease
  - Completion patterns: finished, completed, done with, wrapped up
  - Progress patterns: percentages, halfway, almost done
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-006: Add failure analysis to MutationEngine
- Implemented: Episode failure pattern analysis
- Files changed:
  - evolution/mutations.py (added FailureAnalysis dataclass, analyze_low_fitness_episodes, _generate_fixes_from_patterns)
  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 12 tests for failure analysis)
- Learnings:
  - Categorize failures: too_long, too_short, wrong_mode, missed_frustration, low_engagement, off_topic
  - Skip high-fitness episodes when analyzing failures
  - Generate targeted fix suggestions based on pattern frequency
  - Track worst episode for debugging
---

## 2026-01-07 - US-007: Add LLM-driven mutation proposals
- Implemented: LLM-based intelligent mutation proposals

  - tests/test_depth_features.py (added 16 tests for intelligent mutations)
- Learnings:
  - Check bool before int/float since bool is subclass of int
  - Use heuristic fallback when LLM unavailable or fails

- Learnings:
  - Use trust level gating (>0.7) for autonomous task creation
  - 12-hour cooldown prevents duplicate task creation for same goal
  - Task type determined by goal category: learning -> research, others -> plan
  - All tasks have origin='goal_derived' for audit trail
  - Added defaults to Goal dataclass for easier test construction
